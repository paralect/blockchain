**ii) MultiChain**

MultiChain is a platform where users can establish and deploy private blockchains within an organization or between organizations. It is an open source platform based on Bitcoinâ€™s Blockchain, except in MultiChain you must configure the multichain at every node as opposed to the Bitcoin Blockchain where anyone can connect and transfer assets on the chain.

/// Key features:

- Native multi-currency support  
- Expected to be faster than Bitcoin  
- Permissioned management  
- Quick deployments  
- Supported languages - Python, C#, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby  
- MultiChain forked from the Bitcoin Blockchain allowing users to control whether the chain is private or public, permissions to connect to the network, target time for blocks, and maximum block size and metadata.
