### **e) Private (Permissioned) Blockchains:**

The primary difference between permissioned blockchains and public (permissionless) blockchains is the ability for members to restrict access.

**i) Hyperledger Fabric**

Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger 
technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in enterprise contexts.

Hyperledger project is an umbrella project of open source blockchains and related tools, started in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation,[1] and supported by big industry players like IBM, Intel and SAP Ariba, to support the collaborative development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers.

/// Features of Fabric 

- Smart contracts authored in general-purpose programming languages such as:   
	. Java, Go and Node.js
- Smart contracts (“chaincode”) run within a container environment (e.g. Docker) for isolation. 	
- Fabric has pluggable consensus protocols
- Fabric can leverage consensus protocols that do not require a native cryptocurrency  
	. Details: 
	  To incent costly mining or to fuel smart contract execution. Avoidance of a cryptocurrency 
	  reduces some significant risk/attack vectors, and absence of cryptographic mining operations 
	  means that the platform can be deployed with roughly the same operational cost as any other 
	  distributed system.
- For enterprise use, we need to consider the following requirements:  
	Participants must be identified/identifiable  
	Networks need to be permissioned  
	High transaction throughput performance  
	Low latency of transaction confirmation  
	Privacy and confidentiality of transactions and data pertaining to business transactions
